## Standards
Like all professionals, we have standards! This part of the document will have standards added to them as they are created.

### Naming Conventions
Folders are named using `UpperCamelCase`, and files are named using `lowerCamelCase`. Easy!

### Database
Table names are named using `UpperCamelCase`, and column names are named using `lowerCamelCase`.

### Branches
`main` will be used as the development branch, and a separate, protected production branch will be made later. 
Branch names should be `kebab-case` as per Git standards.

### Spaces v.s. Tabs
Tabs.
